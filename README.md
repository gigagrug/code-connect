# CodeConnect

## Development Setup
You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed if you want to edit [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) (a css framework).
```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run tw
```
Choose either [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). (They will work the exact same I just prefer Docker). 
### With Python
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh
flask run
```

### With Docker
```sh
docker compose up -w
```

## TODO
- [ ]  Add support for messages to notify user what happened (ex. Success and Error)
